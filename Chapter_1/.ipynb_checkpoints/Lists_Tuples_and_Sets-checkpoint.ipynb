Tuples are so much like lists that you may wonder why Python bothers to include them. The reason is that tuples have important roles that can’t be efficiently filled by lists, such as keys for dictionaries."

    "1) Lists and tuples are structures that embody the idea of a sequence of elements, as are strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Lists are like arrays in other languages, but with automatic resizing, slice notation, and many convenience functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Tuples are like lists but can’t be modified, so they use less memory and can be dictionary keys (see chapter 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Sets are iterable collections, but they’re unordered and can’t have duplicate elements."
